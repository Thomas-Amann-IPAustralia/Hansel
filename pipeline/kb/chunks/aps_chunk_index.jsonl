It did not explicitly warn against their use. The sixth edition recommended against using ‘i.e.’, ‘e.g.’ and ‘etc.’ in paragraph text and in formal content.\nThe digital edition removes the sixth edition requirement to use full stops with non-Latin abbreviations. Exceptions to this rule are:\n- Latin shortened forms (including for the formal names of plants and animals)  \n- the abbreviation for ‘no date’ (n.d.) used in referencing and citation.\nThe new general rule is supported by corpus information checked with the Australian National Dictionary Centre. It is consistent with the recommendation to use minimal punctuation.

People might understand common contractions like ‘Prof’ for ‘Professor’, but some shortened forms are confusing. For example, the initialism for ‘Pro Vice-Chancellor’ is ‘PVC’.

If you have to use initials and the shortened forms of titles in a caption, always include the full forms in body text to provide context.\n‘Dr’ is an exception in all instances. Like ‘Ms’ and ‘Mr’, ‘Dr’ is easy to understand when it appears before a name.\n**Example**\n> Departmental officers recently attended Upsilon University’s annual Copyright Symposium.

You can check the spelling of a place name using the [Australian Place Names dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-94f7b168-92a5-4d2a-9346-997bc4f708f7).\nIf still unsure, contact the relevant state or territory naming authority. You can click on the government logos in the search results from the dataset. They will take you to the jurisdictional webpage.\nOfficial place names are generally given under Acts of parliament and associated rules. Each state and territory has its own legal and administrative processes.\nNational principles for naming are intended to provide consistency across the country. This helps ensure that wherever we go in Australia, we find names are chosen and spelt in a common way.\nPlace names reflect culture at various points throughout history. Because of this reality, there may appear to be exceptions to the general rules given in this guide.\nThere are many First Nations naming systems across Australia. These were in place before the official national system and continue today.\nMany names from First Nations languages have become official names, used by all Australians. There are also many that have not. Consult directly with relevant communities about conventions for naming and spelling in specific First Nations languages.\n### Spelling and capitalisation\nAustralian place names are proper nouns, written using standard Australian English. Place names:\n- use a standard 26 character alphabet  \n- don’t use diacritical marks  \n- are not possessive  \n- don’t generally have punctuation.\nSome Australian place names stem from other languages. Spelling and capitalisation can change when they’re adopted as an official Australian place name. For example, the official spelling:\n- loses any accent marks or diacritics  \n- adds capitalisation.\n**Correct**  \nD’Entrecasteaux\n**Incorrect**  \nd’Entrecasteaux\n---\n### Punctuation", "anchor_fragment": "#australian-place-names/check-official-place-names-and-style-them-correctly", "source_url": null, "jump_url": null}

[Greeting]  \n> Actually, that's an interesting point. [Adverb]  \n> Excuse me, should I come with you? [Addressing someone]\nYou don’t need a comma after an introductory word if the sentence is very short. This minimises punctuation in very short sentences.\n**Example**\n> Today I went to work.\n---\n### Use a comma after phrases and clauses that change the whole sentence\nUse commas after adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses.

[Adverbial phrase]  \n> Although they were shaking and sweating, the firefighters were relieved to feel the first drops of a downpour.

An example is a time-series chart where the context and order allow users to understand the difference between each capital letter.\nDon’t use a full stop after shortened days and months.

Each involves specific tasks that happen at certain stages in content development. The aim in any level of edit is to meet user needs and make sure content is fit for purpose.\n### Substantive editing focuses on content, style, structure and meaning\nThe substantive edit reviews structural and textual elements when the draft content is complete.\nSubstantive editing shapes text to make meaning clear. It also improves the structure, usability, language and presentation of the content. It is sometimes called a structural edit.\nBefore starting, agree on the scope of the substantive edit in the team.\nThe substantive edit can:\n- conduct a plain English review to check sentence length, replace complex words with simpler alternatives and remove jargon  \n- check the design of the content to make sure it is the best possible format  \n- reorganise content to improve the flow of information and navigation  \n- identify gaps in the content or any information that can be removed  \n- reword content to make it easier to understand and to achieve consistent voice and tone  \n- check compliance with specific government requirements.\nThe style sheet is updated through a substantive edit to record any decisions that can inform a copyedit.\n#### Substantive editing is not rewriting or fact-checking\nSubstantive editing does not:\n- write a significant amount of new content (but it can include advice to add more content)  \n- substantially rewrite to shorten text (but it can involve advice to delete content)  \n- choose the right typeface or apply formatting styles (but can include checking bolded, italicised and underlined font)  \n- fact-check, such as checking names of people and places, dates, citations, quotes or links to external content.\nAn editor can rewrite or fact-check content, but these are separate tasks to substantive editing.

(What many people call ‘proofreading’ is what editors call ‘copyediting’.) The style sheet ensures proofreaders’ work follows earlier style decisions.\nProofreaders do not make changes to content. Proofreaders query issues such as:\n- content that is different to the master copy, including changes, introduced errors and missing content  \n- missing or incorrectly placed elements such as links, page numbers, table headings and captions  \n- design elements like typefaces, heading styles and hierarchies, page breaks and spacing  \n- obvious errors in spelling or grammar, checked against the style sheet  \n- anything that goes against the decisions in the style sheet.\nThe proofreader’s queries go to whoever is responsible for resolving particular issues.\nThere can be several rounds of proofreading until no errors remain. Each time proofing corrections are made, the proofreader should check the content again. Each check ensures there are no flow-on errors to the text, layout or design.\n‘Blind proofreading’ is when there is no master copy. This requires an experienced proofreader, because there is no authorised version to compare against.\n#### Proofreading is not editing\nProofreading is not editing and it is not a substitute for copyediting.\nProofreading does not include checking:\n- for inconsistent language, spelling or grammar  \n- non-textual elements, such as the content of tables or illustrations.\nProofreaders notice issues and query them.

Examples of italicised notes, instructions and extra material in published works include:\n- Theatre and film scripts can use italics for stage directions.  \n- Books often italicise a prelude or brief introductory remark to set the scene.  \n- Musical scripts sometimes use italics for instructions.\nRemember to avoid blocks of italics wherever possible.

If you do this, write ‘emphasis added’ in square brackets following the italicised text.

Italicised titles are now reserved for poems in book form.  \n- The digital edition departs from sixth edition advice to use italics for letters, words and phrases cited as themselves, terms that are deliberately misused and terms that are newly coined. This reflects expert advice about limiting the use of italics in digital content to ensure readability and accessibility.  \n- The guidance for reverse italics has changed from the sixth edition, which recommended single quotes in addition to roman type for words embedded in an italicised title. The digital edition change is in keeping with the principle of minimal punctuation.  \n- The digital edition recommends against use of italics for names or words from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.

A full sentence expresses a complete idea.\nSentences contain at least a subject and a verb.\nA basic sentence can have more components, for example:\n- who did something (the subject)  \n- what they did (the verb)  \n- who or what they did it to (the object or complement).\nThe verb plus the object or complement form the *predicate*. Not all sentences contain an object or complement as part of the predicate.\nA subject and verb can be enough to complete the subject–predicate structure of a sentence.\n**Example**\n> The manager moved.  \n> [The subject is ‘the manager’. The verb or predicate is ‘moved’.]\n> The manager moved their desk.  \n> [The subject is ‘the manager’. The verb is ‘moved’ and the object or complement is ‘their desk’. ‘Moved their desk’ is the predicate.]\nThe predicate can sometimes appear as a whole sentence because the subject is implied.

The predicate is the verb ‘confirm’, plus the object or complement ‘your password’.]\n---\n### Subject\nThe subject is the person or thing that is doing the action in the sentence.

The agency ran out of funding.  \n> [‘The agency’ is the subject of both sentences.]\n---\n### Complex sentences\nA complex sentence contains a main clause and at least one subordinate clause.\nYou can start the sentence with the main clause.\n**Example**", "anchor_fragment": "#parts-of-sentences/sentences-are-simple-compound-or-complex", "source_url": null, "jump_url": null}

Try to rewrite into shorter, clearer sentences.\nTo use minimal punctuation:\n- Don’t add full stops to the ends of headings, page headers, footers or captions.  \n- Don’t use a semicolon at the end of each item in a bullet list.  \n- Unless each item is a full sentence or the last item in a list, don’t use a full stop for items in bullet lists.  \n- Don’t use full stops between letters in an acronym or initialism.  \n- Don’t use a full stop at the end of most abbreviations.\nMinimal punctuation helps users understand your content.\n---", "anchor_fragment": "#punctuation-and-capitalisation/use-minimal-punctuation-to-make-meaning-clear", "source_url": null, "jump_url": null}

Minimal capitalisation is the principle of writing with the minimum amount of capitalisation required to make the context understood. It is paired with the principle or convention of minimal punctuation.\nConsistent with the sixth edition, an ‘initial capital’ means that the first letter of a word is capitalised.

Overusing semicolons makes writing more difficult to understand.\nSemicolons can create a break that is stronger than a comma but weaker than a full stop. They can link 2 sentences that share or develop an idea. The information must be closely related.\n**Example**\n> He wrote a report for each group. The red report was for one group; the blue report was for the other.  \n> Sometimes it’s optional; sometimes it’s compulsory.\nInstead of a semicolon, it’s usually best to use either:\n- a full stop followed by a new sentence  \n- a comma before the last item, followed by a conjunction.\nSentences should be in plain language and no longer than 25 words. Don’t use a semicolon if all it does is make your sentence longer.\n**Write this**\n> Find out if it’s optional or compulsory before you start. Ask someone to help you if you don’t know the difference.\n**Not this**\n> Find out if it’s optional or compulsory before you start; ask someone to help you if you don’t know the difference.\nToo much punctuation makes text crowded and difficult to read. If a sentence has a lot of punctuation marks, it might be a sign that the sentence is too long or complex. Try to rewrite into shorter, clearer sentences.\nIf you have to use a semicolon, on both sides of the semicolon write full sentences. Other than in some sentence lists, it’s incorrect to have a sentence fragment on one side of the semicolon.\n**Correct**\n> Staff can leave at any time; they don’t need a work schedule.\n**Incorrect**\n> Staff can leave at any time; no work schedule.\n---", "anchor_fragment": "#semicolons/avoid-using-a-semicolon-to-link-sentences", "source_url": null, "jump_url": null}

Spelling and word usage can change over time. Make sure you use an up-to-date edition that reflects current language usages.\nDictionaries include any variable spellings for words.

Record decisions you make about alternative spellings in a style sheet.\nThe entry for a spelling can expand on changes to the basic form of a word. These changes show things like the plural, past tense, or the root from which a word is formed. These changes are called ‘inflections’ and ‘derivations’.\nDictionaries will also show hyphenation, when to use capital letters and how to write foreign words and phrases.\n---\n### Specialist dictionaries\nGeneral dictionaries won’t meet all needs. Other dictionaries may have helpful features, for example:\n- more details on origins of words (etymologies)  \n- clearer examples  \n- word division for breaking words over lines of text  \n- appendices.\nSpecialist dictionaries are essential for scientific or technical writing.
